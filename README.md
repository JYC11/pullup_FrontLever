# pullup_FrontLever

## Short one-liner
The purpose of this project is to find if the weighted pull up can be a good predictor of an athlete's front lever ability

The analysis was finished after collecting more data.

## Disclaimer
Since many people may be unfamiliar with the exercises(and strength training and bodyweight exercises), I will try to be as simple as possible. Honestly, I don't feel qualified to write very in depth, hyper accurate, technical explanations of exercises science related topics because I'm just strength training for fun but I'll try my best.

## What is a Weighted Pull Up?
A gif in this case would be worth more than a thousand words so here are two links:
1. A pull up: https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/BWPullup
2. A weighted pull up: https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/WtPullup  (the man in the gif has a dumbbell between his calves)

A pull up and its variants is a exercise that targets and strengthens the back muscles. The difficulty would scale with bodyweight and adding weight to yourself would make the pull up more diffiult.

## What is a Front Lever?
A picture is worth a thousands words as well for the front lever:

2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_lever (if you want an explanation)

The front lever, like the pull up, is a back exercise. It is a static exercise like a plank and it can be scaled in difficulty(difficulty scaling explained more below). 
Also, your height and weight impact the difficulty of the front lever.

## How are the two exercises related?(a very simple and brief overview)
Differences:
1. When you do a pull up your body is perpendicular(90 degrees) with the ground as you perform the movement but when you do a front lever your body is parallel to the ground.
(So a pull up is a vertical pulling exercise and a front lever is a horizontal pulling exercise. The direction of the pulling is different.)
2. A pull up moves your body through space(up and down) while when you do a front lever you do not move.
(A pull up is dynamic while the front lever is static.)

Similarities:
1. Both are back exercises
2. Both can be scaled in difficulty
