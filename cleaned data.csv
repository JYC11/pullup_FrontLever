Currently my 1rm Pull Up is Bw (58kg) @11-14%bf +18kg with good form, none of that shoulder rounding crap. I currently have a 10s Advanced tuck and a wanky 3s with my legs forward a bit more.

12/20/2020 11:42,30%-50%,Advanced Tuck lever,"Ever since training the front lever, I noticed my right upper lat is doing way more work than my left side. First I thought it's because that side is just weaker, but when measuring my arms length, my left arm is 1 cm shorter than the right arm. When thinking about this, this means that my right arm needs to pull harder for my left arm to reach the bar and fully extend, meaning it has to work harder. 

Now it could also just be that my body shape is just a bit crooked, when training I usually give up because my right side can't hold it anymore. I am stuck in the advanced tuck lever. 

My point is that our bodies are not symmetrical and my guess  is that there are a lot of different assymetric aspects across all human bodies that could also make the front lever harder for the other.
